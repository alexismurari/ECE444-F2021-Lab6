## Test cases for group project
The tests for the search_url function were made by me
https://github.com/ECE444-2021Fall/project1-education-pathways-group-14-commuters/blob/621259c866710c35567b848bf3bae1f0f127769f/search_test.py#L1-L44

## Pros and Cons of TDD
### Pros

The Pros of TDD are that:
- since it requires to run a series of different test on a functional requirement, a developer will be constraint into making this process automated which will make the testing a lot faster and effective.
- the costs of fixing issues early on is minor
- as the tests are made early on it makes the implementation more robust  
- as we keep refactoring the code with this method the code will be more efficient and compact

### Cons
The Cons of TDD are that:
- TDD does not guarantee that all components will be tested fully (some corner cases may be missed) 
- if another approach is taken to solve a problem or a different implementation is selected, the previous tests may need to be modified and new ones need to be added  
- time/costs may be greater as well, even though TDD may save a lot of time and effort near the end of the project it still requires time and costs to make good testing
